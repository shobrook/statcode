  description: "This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK \
                and that the client should continue with the request or ignore \
                it if it is already finished."

101:
  message: "Switching Protocol"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header by \
                the client, and indicates the protocol the server is switching to."

                processing the request, but no response is available yet."

200:
  message: "OK"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The request has succeeded. The meaning of a success varies \
                depending on the HTTP method:
                GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the \
                message body.
                HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
                PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is \
                transmitted in the message body.
                TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received \
                by the server"

# Successful Responses

201:
  message: "Created"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as \
                a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a POST \
                request, or after some PUT requests."

202:
  message: "Accepted"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is \
                non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send \
                an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the \
                request. It is intended for cases where another process or server \
                handles the request, or for batch processing."

203:
  message: "Non-Authoritative Information"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "This response code means returned meta-information set is not \
                exact set as available from the origin server, but collected from \
                a local or a third party copy. Except this condition, 200 OK \
                response should be preferred instead of this response."

204:
  message: "No Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "There is no content to send for this request, but the headers \
                may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for \
                this resource with the new ones."

  message: "Multi-Status (WebDav)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "A Multi-Status response conveys information about multiple \
                resources in situations where multiple status codes might be \
                appropriate."

208:
  message: "Multi-Status (WebDav)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating \
                the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection \
                repeatedly."

226:
  message: "IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the \
                response is a representation of the result of one or more \
                instance-manipulations applied to the current instance."

# Redirection Messages

300:
  message: "Multiple Choice"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "The request has more than one possible response. The user-agent \
                or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way \
                of choosing one of the responses."

301:
  message: "Moved Permanently"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This response code means that the URI of the requested resource \
                has been changed. Probably, the new URI would be given in the \
                response."

302:
  message: "Found"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This response code means that the URI of requested resource has \
                been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made \
                in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the \
                client in future requests."

303:
  message: "See Other"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "The server sent this response to direct the client to get the \
                requested resource at another URI with a GET request."

304:
  message: "Not Modified"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the \
                response has not been modified, so the client can continue to \
                use the same cached version of the response."

305:
  message: "Use Proxy"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "Was defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to \
                indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy. \
                It has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band \
                configuration of a proxy."

306:
  message: "Unused"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This response code is no longer used, it is just reserved \
                currently. It was used in a previous version of the HTTP 1.1 \
                specification."

307:
  message: "Temporary Redirect"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "The server sends this response to direct the client to get the \
                requested resource at another URI with same method that was used \
                in the prior request. This has the same semantics as the 302 Found \
                HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must \
                not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first \
                request, a POST must be used in the second request."

308:
  message: "Permanent Redirect"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This means that the resource is now permanently located at another \
                URI, specified by the Location: HTTP Response header. This has \
                the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response \
                code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the \
                HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first request, a POST \
                must be used in the second request."

# Client Error Responses

400:
  message: "Bad Request"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response means that server could not understand the request \
                due to invalid syntax."

401:
  message: "Unauthorized"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "Although the HTTP standard specifies 'unauthorized', semantically \
                this response means 'unauthenticated'. That is, the client must \
                authenticate itself to get the requested response."

402:
  message: "Payment Required"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response code is reserved for future use. Initial aim for \
                creating this code was using it for digital payment systems \
                however this is not used currently."

403:
  message: "Forbidden"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The client does not have access rights to the content, i.e. they \
                are unauthorized, so server is rejecting to give proper response. \
                Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server."

404:
  message: "Not Found"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The server can not find requested resource. In the browser, this \
                means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean \
                that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. \
                Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide the \
                existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response \
                code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent occurence \
                on the web."

405:
  message: "Method Not Allowed"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The request method is known by the server but has been disabled \
                and cannot be used. For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a \
                resource. The two mandatory methods, GET and HEAD, must never be \
                disabled and should not return this error code."

406:
  message: "Not Acceptable"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response is sent when the web server, after performing \
                server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content \
                following the criteria given by the user agent."

407:
  message: "Proxy Authentication Required"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This is similar to 401 but authentication is needed to be done \
                by a proxy."

408:
  message: "Request Timeout"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, \
                even without any previous request by the client. It means that \
                the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This \
                response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, \
                Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed \
                up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the \
                connection without sending this message."

409:
  message: "Conflict"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current \
                state of the server."

410:
  message: "Gone"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response would be sent when the requested content has been \
                permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. \
                Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the \
                resource. The HTTP specification intends this status code to be \
                used for 'limited-time, promotional services'. APIs should not \
                feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with \
                this status code."

411:
  message: "Length Required"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "Server rejected the request because the Content-Length header \

415:
  message: "Unsupported Media Type"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The media format of the requested data is not supported by the \

  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The range specified by the Range header field in the request \
                can't be fulfilled; it's possible that the range is outside the \

417:
  message: "Expectation Failed"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response code means the expectation indicated by the Expect \

                protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades \
                to a different protocol. The server sends an Upgrade header in a \
                426 response to indicate the required protocol(s)."

428:
  message: "Precondition Required"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended \
                to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's \
                state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a \
                third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a \
